## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

I expanded my knowledge of v-model to create search filters.

### Continued development

I'm continuing to learn how the composition api works. I need to get better with code abstraction and also need to create components more fluidly.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is always open and it's really easy to learn how other people approach code.
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - For this project I constantly went back to learn all the ins and out of Vue.
